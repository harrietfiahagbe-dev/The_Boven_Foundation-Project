# LARAVEL CONVENTIONS

## Artisan Commands
- Use artisan commands: `php artisan make:model`, `make:controller`, etc.
- In Laravel 11+, commands in `app/Console/Commands/` auto-register

## Configuration
- Config over env: Use `config('app.name')` NOT `env('APP_NAME')`

## Database & Eloquent
- Eager load relationships to avoid N+1:
```php
$users = User::with('posts')->get();
```

- Use soft deletes for models:
```php
use SoftDeletes;
```

- Use transactions for multi-step database operations

## Best Practices
- Form Requests for validation
- Route Model Binding for cleaner controllers
